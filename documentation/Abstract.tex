    Jinping Neutrino Experiment (JNE) plan to use a new type of 8-inch MCP-PMT with high photon detection efficiency for MeV-scaled neutrino measurements. This work presents the implemented testing procedures and the characteristics of a set of MCP-PMTs, compared to a commercial 8-inch dynode PMT with typical quantum efficiency. Tests demonstrate that the photon detection efficiency, the transition time spread, and the charge peak-valley ratio are significantly better than the reference PMT. Considering the influence of long tail in charge distribution, the boost of photon detection efficiency still contributes to the detector energy resolution in theory. All measured parameters can be used in the simulation for further research. The new type of MCP-PMT is promising in the MeV-scaled neutrino experiments.
